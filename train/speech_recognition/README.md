Run the first program to create MFCCs then run the second program to train.

If you want to trim your dataset or want a 'other' word that picks up when none of the words wanted are said, use the RemoveUnwantedFiles.py script. It SHOULD NOT be in the dataset directory and will delete a lot of files in the dataset. Open it to modify according to your system (file paths and unwanted words).
